## React HelloWorld Application

This project is a simple "Hello, World" web application built using React and containerized using Docker. The application is designed to be easy to build, run, and deploy.

```

### Prerequisites

- **Docker**: Ensure Docker is installed and running on your machine.
- **Node.js**: If you want to run the application locally without Docker.

### How to Build and Run

1. **Make the `build_and_run.sh` script executable:**

   ```bash
   chmod +x build_and_run.sh
   ```

2. **Build and Run the Docker Container:**

   Run the following script to build the Docker image and start the container:

   ```bash
   ./build_and_run.sh
   ```

   This will:
   - Build the Docker image with the tag `react-helloworld`.
   - Run the container, mapping port `3000` on your local machine to port `3000` in the container.

3. **Access the Application:**

   Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` to see the application running.

### Troubleshooting

#### 1. **Container Exits Immediately**

If the container exits immediately after starting, check the logs to see the error message:

```bash
docker logs [container_id]
```

Replace `[container_id]` with the actual container ID, which you can find by running:

```bash
docker ps -a
```

#### 2. **Port 3000 Already in Use**

If you get an error that port `3000` is already in use, either stop the service using that port or run the container on a different port:

```bash
docker run -d -p 8080:3000 react-helloworld
```

Then access the application at `http://localhost:8080`.



#### 3. **Permission Denied on `build_and_run.sh`**

If you get a "Permission Denied" error when running the script, make sure it has execute permissions:

```bash
chmod +x build_and_run.sh
```

### .gitignore

The following `.gitignore` file is used to ignore unnecessary files and directories:

```plaintext
# dependencies
node_modules/

# production
build/

# misc
.DS_Store
```
