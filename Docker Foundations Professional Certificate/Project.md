- **Framework:** Flask (lightweight web application framework)
- **Containerization Tool:** Docker
- **Version Control & Repository Management:** Docker Image Repository

### Deliverables
The final project will include:
- Website files, including code and assets.
- A **Dockerfile** containing the necessary instructions to build a Docker image.
- A **Docker image** with the required software and dependencies to run the application.
- A **Docker image repository** for securely storing and managing the Docker image.
- A **Docker command cheat sheet** for quick reference and streamlined execution.

### Expected Benefits
