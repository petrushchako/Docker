# Learning Docker
#### **By:** Carlos Nunez
Containers help developers pack up their applications, ensuring they run smoothly anywhere. Software developers need to understand these technologies to deliver software as a team. Whether you are new to Docker or looking to review the fundamentals, these courses can help. Tune in, pass the final exam, and earn your certificate.

### Learning objectives
- Define Docker and explain common use cases.
- Understand how containers functionally and operationally differ from virtual machines.
- Explore three key technologies that make Docker different: layered containers, the Dockerfile, and the Docker API.
- Learn how to create and manage containers using the Docker CLI.
- Understand how to create custom container images using Dockerfiles.
- Learn how to push Docker images to the Docker registry and manage them.
- Troubleshoot common container issues using Docker CLI commands.
- Understand common best practices and problems when working with Docker containers and images.

## Docker Explained
### What is Docker?
#### Previous Solutions
- **Configuration managment tools (Chef, Puppet, Ansible)**<br>Require knowledge about hardware and operating system
- **Virtual machines as code (Vagrant)**<br>Heavy, slowish, require inconvenient configuration
### Docker
Docker uses **images** and **containers** to allow apps to run anywhere, consistently.
